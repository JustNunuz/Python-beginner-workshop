Functions #1: print Hello World
-------
Write a function called myfunc that prints the string 'Hello World'.

For example:

.. code-block:: python

    def myfunc():
        print('Some text')


Functions #2: print Hello Name
-------
Define a function called myfunc that takes in a name, and prints 'Hello Name'

For example:

.. code-block:: python

    def myfunc(name):
        print(f'My name is {name}')


Functions #3 - simple Boolean
-------
Define a function called myfunc that takes in a Boolean value (True or False). If True, return 'Hello', and if False, return 'Goodbye'


Functions #4 - using Booleans
-------
Define a function called myfunc that takes three arguments, x, y and z.
If z is True, return x.  If z is False, return y.


Functions #5: simple math
-------
Define a function called myfunc that takes in two arguments and returns their sum.



Functions #6: is even
-------
Define a function called is_even that takes in one argument, and returns True if the passed-in value is even, False if it is not.

Functions #7: is greater
-------
Define a function called is_greater that takes in two arguments, and returns True if the first value is greater than the second, False if it is less than or equal to the second.

Bonus Question!
-------
Define a function called myfunc that takes in a string, and returns a matching string where every even letter is uppercase, and every odd letter is lowercase. Assume that the incoming string only contains letters, and don't worry about numbers, spaces or punctuation. The output string can start with either an uppercase or lowercase letter, so long as letters alternate throughout the string.

For Example:
.. code-block:: python
    myfunc('Anthropomorphism')
    # Output: 'aNtHrOpOmOrPhIsM'
